### ASI lost and found locker and snapchat campus stories were so last year

### PolyFinder 

# ASI lost and found locker and snapchat campus stories are a primitive way to find and report items lost around Cal Poly. PolyFinder is an innovative webapp that allows anyone with a Cal Poly email to register an account and from there they can post a detailed listing of an item that they either found or found on campus. It helps bring the community together by making sure nothing is left behind.
